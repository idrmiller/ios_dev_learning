# My 2015 Journey into iOS Development

##Overview
I started my journey into iOS development earlier this year when I had an idea for an app that I tested out with some interested users. So, I figured this would be a great opportunity to start learning iOS for myself. I am realizing that I really enjoy programming in Xcode and for iOS. I think it mostly has to do with the rapid feedback of progress. Swift as a language is very user friendly, reminds me alot of Ruby and Python, in regards of ease of use. 

Well, I will continue to try and document my experience along the way.
